Project Description
A fun Arduino project where you and the system both vote, but it randomly ignores or replaces your votes. Even ties get an extra pointless round before deciding a winner.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
It ‚Äúsolves‚Äù the nonexistent problem of making voting unnecessarily unpredictable and complicated, just for fun.
[What ridiculous problem are you solving?]
A fun, over-engineered way to pick a winner using random chance, extra rules, and blinking lights.

[How are you solving it? Keep it fun!]
